# This is a learner's practice codebase

All the code written here is for practice and making sure my logic works. I revisit the code from time to time to revise, optimise, improve and maintain this codebase. Please have a look and help with the learning process by sharing our knowledge.

dsa.js has all the Datastructures and Algorithm implementations
JavaScript.js has random javascript practice, implementation and problem solving

BetterComments - A VSCode extention is extensively used with this codebase. It will enhance the readability, I recommend using it.
