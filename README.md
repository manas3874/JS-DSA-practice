## This is a learner's practice codebase

All the code written here is for practice and making sure my logic works. I revisit the code from time to time to revise, optimise, improve and maintain this codebase. Please have a look and help with the learning process by sharing your knowledge.

* *dsa.js* has all the "current" Datastructures and Algorithm implementations.

* *JavaScript.js* has random javascript practice, implementation and problem solving.

* Other datastructures which are successfully implemented and ready to use are stored in separate *modules* from which we can import any ADT on our command.

>[**BetterComments**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) - A VSCode extention which is extensively used with this codebase. It will enhance the readability, I recommend using it.

>[**Bracket pair colorizer**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - A tool to make the content more readable. Since JavaScript involves deep nesting of brackets, it is great to have a visual guide to help read the code.
