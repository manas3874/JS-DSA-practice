# This is a learner's practice codebase

All the code written here is for practice and making sure my logic works. I revisit the code from time to time to revise, optimise, improve and maintain this codebase. Please have a look and help with the learning process by sharing your knowledge.

1. dsa.js has all the "current" Datastructures and Algorithm implementations

2. JavaScript.js has random javascript practice, implementation and problem solving

3. Other datastructures which are successfully implemented and ready to use are stored in separate modules from which we can import any ADT on our command

BetterComments - A VSCode extention is extensively used with this codebase. It will enhance the readability, I recommend using it.
